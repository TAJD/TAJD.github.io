I completed a degree in Ship Science at the University of Southampton, graduating in 2016. I learnt about a range of engineering subjects and how to apply them to designing Yachts and Small Craft. I completed a year in industry between my second and third years where I worked as a naval architect. 

As part of my undergraduate project I contributed towards [research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299426271_Rapid_prototyping_of_flexible_models_-_a_new_methods_for_model_testing) into the use of 3d printing to manufacture ship models which flex realistically. In my MEng project I worked as part of a team to evaluate autonomous control concepts for use on ships through implementing them on a test platform. I programmed microcontrollers, undertook naval architectural analysis on concept design and planned, executed and analysed trials.
