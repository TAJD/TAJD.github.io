title: Uncertainty in Marine Weather Routing, An Investigation into Polynesian Seafaring
description: modelling uncertainty in marine weather routing
summary: I developed a new methodology to model the influence of uncertainty from varied sources in the marine weather routing process. I applied this methodology to model the influence of climate and vessel performance on the challenge of settling Polynesia.

As part of my research I collaborated on various research outputs:

- I presented a conference paper on [Reliability informed weather routing for autonomous sailing craft]({{ site.url }}/assets/papers/reliability_routing.pdf).
- I delivered a [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9734QKifKg) on the use of [Julia](https://julialang.org/) in my research. You can find the code that I developed [here](https://github.com/TAJD/SailRoute.jl).
- I co-authored a [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141118719300380) applying numerical methods to marine weather routing. An arxiv version can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03840).
