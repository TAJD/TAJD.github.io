I have experience in building data analytics applications, with particular experience in data engineering, data science and analytics engineering. I have an Engineering PhD and my practical experience ranges from sports engineering, defence, non profits and the transport industry. I am skilled at rapidly learning about the background of a problem in order to identify the best software solution to create a product.

I am interested in working on projects such as:

- __Exploratory data analysis__. I can clean and analyse a raw dataset to provide detailed insight to solve business problems.
- __Data pipeline design and implementation__. I can design and implement a system which will take raw data and apply a data science solution at scale.
- __Minimum viable product development__. Given a business idea I can develop a data driven application to be your minimum viable product.

Previous work has included:

- Development of a data driven training analysis tool for an Olympic sports team. The solution involved developing a Python application using Plotly and Pandas and a deployment on Heroku.
- A data dashboard which identifies suitable houses and apartments for rent given user preferences on price, commuting and access to preferred locations. I integrated house data from the Zillow API, transport times from the TfL API and proximity to user selected shops from Google APIs. The output  was a dashboard which summarised house price and key information to give a personalised solution for the user. The implementation was a Python application exposing a dashboard written using Bokeh to the user.
- Development of a monitoring solution for a data analytics system. Time series forecasting techniques were applied to various metrics to provide a twice daily report into system behaviour. The report improved decision making on the correctness of data being exposed to users as well as confirming that the system was functioning as intended.
- Implementation of an API to access a machine learning model. I implemented an API to enable secure developer access to a machine learning model deployed in the cloud.
