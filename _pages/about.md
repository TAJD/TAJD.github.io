title: About

I currently work at [Dynamon](https://dynamon.co.uk/) focusing on reducing the emissions produced by the road logistics sector.

See the [Consulting](consulting) page to learn more about the products I build and what I'm interested on working on.

I have a background in Naval Architecture and have experience working in multiple sectors. I have a PhD in Engineering which involved me developing a numerical model to investigate just how hard it was for humans to settle Polynesia. I enjoy learning about mathematics and software engineering and how they can be combined to analyse data and solve problems. Occasionally I contribute towards open source software.

I use this website to record more formal notes on software development and data science. I'm a fan of the idea of _learning in public_ but I also know that I only understand something if I have to explain it - even if only to myself.

The mistakes on this website are entirely my own but I am willing to share the blame. If you've found something useful or have a suggestion then feel free to send me an email at tajdickson@protonmail.com.

You can find me online at [Github](https://github.com/TAJD) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/thomas_dickson).
