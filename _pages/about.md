# About

I am currently working as the English Institute of Sport Research Fellow in the Maritime Engineering research group at the University of Southampton. Read my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/thomas_dickson_cv.pdf) to learn about my background.

My research interests include applying machine learning to marine problems, quantitative modelling of sports and using naval architecture in archaeological problems.

# Website

I'm using this website as an open crib sheet/notes to record some of the things that I find useful to solve the problems that I come across in my life. Although each page is ordered by date I update the information almost at random.

If you find any of the material on my website helpful or you have a comment to make please let me know, I'd love to hear.
