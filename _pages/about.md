# About

I am a full stack data scientist currently working at [Dynamon](https://dynamon.co.uk/). 

Jack of all trades, master of none. I have, or have had, interests in computer science, naval architecture, maths and archaeology.

# Website

I'm using this website to record some of the things I learn in the hope that someone else might find them useful. Another reason is that the act of writing things down helps me clarify my own thoughts. The mistakes on this website are entirely my own.

Do send me an email if you find an error - I'm keen to rectify any mistakes or improve poor communication.
