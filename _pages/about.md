# About

I currently work at [Dynamon](https://dynamon.co.uk/) focusing on reducing the emissions produced by the road logistics sector. See the [Consulting](consulting) page to learn more about the products that I build.

I have a background in Naval Architecture and have experience working in the maritime and logistics sectors. I have a PhD in Engineering which involved me developing a numerical model to investigate just how hard it was for humans to settle Polynesia.

I use this website to record notes on software development and data science. I'm a fan of the idea of _learning in public_ but I also know that I only understand something if I have to explain it. The mistakes on this website are entirely my own. Send me an email at tajdickson@protonmail.com if you have a suggestion.

You can find me online at [Github](https://github.com/TAJD) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/thomas_dickson).
