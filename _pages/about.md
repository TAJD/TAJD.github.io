# About

I am a full stack data scientist currently working at [Dynamon](https://dynamon.co.uk/). 

Jack of all trades, master of none. I have, or have had, interests in computer science, naval architecture, maths and archaeology.

# Website

I'm using this website to record some of the things I learn in the hope that someone else might find them useful. A more selfish reason is that I enjoy writing about ideas because this helps me learn more about the topics I'm interested in. 

The mistakes on this website are entirely my own. Send me an email at tajdickson@protonmail.com if you find an error - I'm keen to rectify any mistakes or improve poor communication.
