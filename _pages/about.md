# About

<!-- I produce data driven solutions to complex problems. I am currently working as the English Institute of Sport Research Fellow in the Maritime Engineering research group at the University of Southampton.   -->

I am a full stack data scientist currently working at [Dynamon](https://dynamon.co.uk/). I work on problems across the stack: from storing and processing data through to analysis and presenting insights on the frontend. I previously worked as the English Institute of Sport Research Fellow at the University of Southampton where I supported Team GB with scientific research.

# Website

I'm using this website as an open crib sheet/notes to record some of the solutions that I've found useful for solving technical problems I've come across. If you find any of the material on my website helpful or you have a comment to make please let me know, I'd love to hear.
