# About

I am currently working as the English Institute of Sport Research Fellow in the Maritime Engineering research group at the University of Southampton.  Find my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/thomas_dickson_cv.pdf).

My research interests include applying machine learning to marine problems, quantitative modelling of sports and using naval architecture in archaeological problems.

# Website

I'm using this website as an open crib sheet/notes to record some of the things that I find useful to solve the problems that I come across in my life. 

If you find any of the material on my website helpful or you have a comment to make please let me know, I'd love to hear.
