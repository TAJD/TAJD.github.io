# About

I produce data driven solutions to complex problems. I am currently working as the English Institute of Sport Research Fellow in the Maritime Engineering research group at the University of Southampton.  Find my resume [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/resume.pdf).

# Website

I'm using this website as an open crib sheet/notes to record the things that I find useful to solve the problems that I come across in my life. If you find any of the material on my website helpful or you have a comment to make please let me know, I'd love to hear.
