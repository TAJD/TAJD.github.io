I"ÿ<p>Given the COVID outbreak and associated work from home period I thought now might be a good opportunity to <del>re</del>learn some of the mathematics which underpin statistical learning. I identified the <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/">MIT 18.065</a> course as having good potential for this purpose. This post records my experience of following the lecture series and completing the example problems over the previous thirty or so days.</p>

<p>The process of watching the lecture and taking notes took be between $1.5$ to $2$ hours every day.</p>

<p>. Given the lack of anything better to do over the COVID lockdown I decided to devote 1.5 hours a day taking notes on the recorded lectures and associated.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can tell Gil knows how to teach the fundamentals of linear algebra</li>
  <li>Questions online - no solutions but those are not hard to find if you have access to the rest of the internet. Gil does provide some answers on the book website but these drop out after the first few sections.</li>
  <li>I did the questions associated with each lecture.</li>
  <li>The textbook is well worth it. The course, as are most good courses, under development and the textbook sometimes has alternative and clearer expositions of what is explained in the lectures.</li>
  <li>Most of the set questions are variations on things in the main textbook.</li>
  <li>Identifying suitable project ideas.</li>
</ul>
