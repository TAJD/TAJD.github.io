# Summary 

This is a page of resources which I've found useful in rounding out my computer science knowledge. I had an awakening with one of the first interviews I had when I was looking for work in industry - I was asked a series of questions which I simply didn't have a clue on, despite having written some tricky code. Well, that was then. The key learning points for me are:

1. Coding interviews are about solving specific problems which aim to demonstrate knowledge of solving classic computer science problems.
1. Coding interviews are necessary to filter out candidates who aren't prepared to put the work in. 
1. Preparing for coding interviews actually makes me a better programmer. The process of specifically practicing how to triage and solve problems helps me solve some of the problems I come across in my own work.



# Useful books

There are two key books which are invaluable for those of a non computer science background. 

- [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/) is a key text on key algorithms and data structures. The author is quite chatty which makes it quite readable in my opinion. However I have spent too much time in academia so I might not be the best judge on how dry any given textbook may or may not be.
- [Cracking the coding interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) This appears to be a great guide on structuring ones approach to applying to jobs in the software industry. It's a staple.


# Useful websites for practicing coding problems

- [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a popular website which has problems sorted by topic and difficulty. 
- [codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/) is a website I've come across for some interviews. The lessons are not bad.
- [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a website similar to hackerrank but has problems contributed by the users. I think it's better than hackerrank as the UI is better and there are more problems to solve in a wider range of languages.
- [geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-do-coding-questions-for-companies-like-amazon-microsoft-adobe/?ref=leftbar) has aquite a lot of questions on different topics. My current go-to. You can convert your cash into their made up money tokens which can be used to purchase courses.
